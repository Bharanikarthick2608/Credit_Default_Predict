# Credit Risk Analysis and Prediction Framework
## Executive Summary
This document outlines a comprehensive approach to analyzing credit risk and predicting loan defaults for a mid-sized bank. The analysis combines traditional statistical methods with modern machine learning techniques to provide actionable business insights.

## 1. Data Preprocessing and Initial Analysis

### 1.1 Data Quality Assessment
- Check for missing values and outliers
- Validate data ranges (e.g., age should be reasonable, income should be positive)
- Examine distribution of numerical variables
- Verify categorical variable consistency

### 1.2 Feature Engineering
**Basic Features:**
- Age brackets (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 55+)
- Income categories (Low, Medium, High based on percentiles)
- Debt-to-Income Ratio = Loan_Amount / Income
- Monthly Loan Burden = Loan_Amount / (Loan_Term * Monthly_Income)
- Transaction Frequency = Transaction_Count / 6 (monthly average)

**Advanced Features:**
- Risk Score = (Credit_Score * 0.4 + Income_Weight * 0.3 + Transaction_History_Weight * 0.3)
- Account Balance Volatility (if historical data available)
- Loan Amount to Credit Score Ratio
- Customer Tenure Score (if available)

## 2. Customer Demographics Analysis

### 2.1 Univariate Analysis
- Age distribution visualization with default rates
- Income distribution across default/non-default customers
- Credit score distribution analysis
- Job category analysis with default rates

### 2.2 Bivariate Analysis
- Age vs. Income correlation with default overlay
- Credit Score vs. Loan Amount relationship
- Transaction Count vs. Account Balance patterns
- Cross-tabulation of categorical variables (Job, Marital_Status)

### 2.3 Advanced Demographic Insights
- Create demographic clusters using K-means clustering
- Analyze default rates within each cluster
- Identify high-risk demographic segments
- Calculate risk multipliers for each demographic combination

## 3. Transaction and Balance Analysis

### 3.1 Transaction Patterns
- Monthly transaction frequency analysis
- Transaction amount distribution
- Identification of transaction thresholds
- Seasonal patterns (if applicable)

### 3.2 Balance Analysis
- Account balance trends
- Balance-to-loan ratio analysis
- Minimum balance maintenance patterns
- Balance volatility assessment

### 3.3 Advanced Transaction Metrics
- Transaction consistency score
- Balance maintenance score
- Cash flow health indicator
- Transaction diversity index

## 4. Customer Segmentation

### 4.1 Segmentation Approach
1. **RFM Analysis Modified for Banking:**
   - Recency: Last transaction date
   - Frequency: Transaction count
   - Monetary: Average balance maintained

2. **Value-Based Segmentation:**
- Premium Customers (High balance, multiple products)
- Mid-Tier Customers (Stable balance, few products)
- Basic Customers (Low balance, single product)
- At-Risk Customers (Irregular patterns)

3. **Risk-Based Segmentation:**
- Low Risk (High credit score, stable income)
- Medium Risk (Average metrics)
- High Risk (Low credit score, unstable patterns)
- Very High Risk (Multiple risk factors)

### 4.2 Segment-Specific Strategies
**Premium Segment:**
- Preferential rates
- Premium banking services
- Relationship manager assignment
- Cross-selling opportunities

**Mid-Tier Segment:**
- Balanced product offerings
- Upgrade pathways
- Targeted savings products
- Investment opportunities

**Basic Segment:**
- Basic banking products
- Financial education
- Credit building products
- Automated saving tools

**At-Risk Segment:**
- Credit counseling
- Debt consolidation options
- Stricter monitoring

1. **Base Models:**
   - Logistic Regression (interpretable baseline)
   - Random Forest (robust performance)
   - XGBoost (high performance)
   - LightGBM (efficient processing)

2. **Advanced Approaches:**
   - Stacked Ensemble (combining multiple models)
   - Neural Networks (for complex patterns)
   - Time-Series Models (for temporal patterns)

### 5.2 Feature Importance Analysis
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
- Permutation importance
- Partial dependence plots
- Feature interaction analysis

### 5.3 Model Evaluation Metrics
1. **Primary Metrics:**
   - Area Under ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)
   - Precision-Recall Curve (PR-AUC)
   - F1-Score
   - Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic

2. **Business Metrics:**
   - Expected Monetary Value (EMV)
   - Cost-benefit analysis
   - Risk-adjusted return
   - Population stability index

3. **Risk Metrics:**
   - Gini coefficient
   - Concentration risk
   - Portfolio at Risk (PAR)
   - Risk-weighted assets
